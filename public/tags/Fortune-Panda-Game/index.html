		<h1 id="Colorado-Joins-Growing-List-of-States-to-Legalize-Online-Poker"><a href="#Colorado-Joins-Growing-List-of-States-to-Legalize-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Joins Growing List of States to Legalize Online Poker"></a>Colorado Joins Growing List of States to Legalize Online Poker</h1><p>After more than a year of debates and deliberations, the Colorado state legislature has finally passed a bill legalizing online poker. The bill now awaits the signature of Governor Jared Polis, who is expected to sign it into law in the coming days.</p>
<p>With this development, Colorado joins a growing number of states that have legalized online poker in recent years. These include Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The passage of the Colorado bill comes as good news for the gaming industry, which has been dealt a series of blows in recent years. The most significant of these was the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in 2018 that struck down the federal ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>Since then, a number of states have moved to legalize sports betting, with some already offering games such as horse racing and casino slots. However, progress on legalizing online poker has been slow, as lawmakers have been cautious about how to regulate the new industry.</p>
<p>This has been especially true in states where casino gambling is already well-established. In such cases, there is concern that legalizing online poker could cannibalize brick-and-mortar casinos’ business.</p>
<p>Colorado is not alone in this regard; several other states are also mulling over proposals to legalize online poker. These include Arkansas, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, and Missouri.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Poker"><a href="#Colorado-Becomes-Latest-State-to-Legalize-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Becomes Latest State to Legalize Online Poker"></a>Colorado Becomes Latest State to Legalize Online Poker</h1><p>Colorado became the latest state to legalize online poker on Monday when Governor Jared Polis signed House Bill 1088 into law. The new law allows for the licensing and regulation of online poker sites by the Colorado Department of Revenue.</p>
<p>“This bill is about consumer protection and ensuring that Coloradans have access to safe, fun and fair gaming options,” said Governor Polis in a statement. “Coloradans have been betting on games of skill or chance for centuries, and it’s time we provide a regulated framework for this activity.”</p>
<p>HB 1088 had broad bipartisan support in the Colorado legislature, passing both chambers unanimously. The bill creates a regulatory framework for licensed online poker operators to offer their services to residents of Colorado. It also requires operators to implement procedures to prevent gambling addiction and underage gambling.</p>
<p>The passage of HB 1088 makes Colorado the 33rd state to legalize some form of online gambling. In addition to poker, the bill allows for the legalization of other casino games such as blackjack, roulette and craps. There is no timeline yet for when online gaming will become available in Colorado, but regulators will need time to draft rules and regulations governing the industry.</p>
<p>Colorado’s move comes as online gaming continues to gain popularity in the United States. A recent report from research firm Playtech found that 83 million Americans (nearly 40% of the population) are interested in playing casino games online. That number is only going to increase as more states legalize online gaming.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Officially-Legalizes-Online-Poker"><a href="#Colorado-Officially-Legalizes-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Officially Legalizes Online Poker"></a>Colorado Officially Legalizes Online Poker</h1><p>In a unanimous vote on Tuesday, the Colorado state Senate passed a bill legalizing online poker. Governor Jared Polis is expected to sign the measure into law, making Colorado the latest U.S. state to legalize online poker.</p>
<p>The new law will allow Colorado residents over 21 years of age to play real-money poker games on their smartphones and computers. The bill also establishes regulations for operators and enforces consumer protections such as player age verification and geo-location tracking.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill follows in the footsteps of Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, and California, all of which have legalized online poker in recent years. The trend suggests that legalized online poker is becoming more and more mainstream, as more states come to see the benefits of regulating the industry.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized online poker argue that it can be a boon to the economy, generating billions of dollars in tax revenue and creating thousands of jobs. They also point to the fact that it is a safer option than playing on unregulated offshore sites, which often lack basic consumer protections.</p>
<p>Opponents of online poker argue that it can be addictive and lead to gambling addiction. They also say that it can be harmful to social relationships and finances. However, these concerns have not been borne out by evidence from states that have already legalized online poker.</p>
<p>Regardless of these concerns, it is clear that online poker is here to stay. As more states legalize it, the industry will only become more mainstream and regulated. This is good news for players who want safe and reliable options for playing poker online.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Moves-Forward-with-Legislation-to-Legalize-Online-Poker"><a href="#Colorado-Moves-Forward-with-Legislation-to-Legalize-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Moves Forward with Legislation to Legalize Online Poker"></a>Colorado Moves Forward with Legislation to Legalize Online Poker</h1><p>Colorado has a lot to offer tourists and residents, with its natural beauty and abundance of outdoor activities. Now, Colorado residents may be able to add poker to their list of attractions, as lawmakers there are moving forward with legislation to legalize online poker.</p>
<p>If the legislation is passed, Colorado would join a number of other states in allowing online poker. States that have legalized online poker have done so in order to create new revenue streams and to help regulate the industry.</p>
<p>In Colorado, lawmakers are hopeful that regulating and legalizing online poker will bring in around $5 million in annual revenue. The money would be used to fund education initiatives in the state.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Colorado were motivated to take up the issue of online poker after a failed attempt to pass legislation legalizing marijuana. They believe that legalizing online poker could be more successful, as there is already a large and well-regulated online poker industry in the United States.</p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation argue that it could lead to gambling addiction problems for some residents of the state. However, supporters of the bill argue that implementing strong regulations can help mitigate those risks.</p>
<p>It is still unclear whether or not the bill will pass, but lawmakers are hopeful that they can come to an agreement on the issue soon.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-Sets-Date-for-Launch-of-Legalized-Online-Poker"><a href="#Colorado-Sets-Date-for-Launch-of-Legalized-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Colorado Sets Date for Launch of Legalized Online Poker"></a>Colorado Sets Date for Launch of Legalized Online Poker</h1><p>Colorado has become the latest state to set a specific date for when it will launch legalized online poker. Regulators say that the industry could be up and running by July 2019.</p>
<p>This news comes on the heels of Pennsylvania’s recent launch of its own online gambling industry, which includes poker. That state became the fourth in the US to offer legalized online poker, joining New Jersey, Nevada, and Delaware.</p>
<p>There is still some question as to whether or not Colorado will offer sports betting in conjunction with online poker. So far, no definitive plans have been announced, but regulators are reportedly considering the possibility.</p>
<p>If Colorado does go ahead with a sports betting platform, it would join a growing number of states that are offering the product in addition to online poker. Currently, that list includes New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and New Mexico.</p>
<p>The news of Colorado’s impending launch is being welcomed by many in the online poker community. Advocates believe that a regulated market will help to combat illegal offshore sites that have been taking advantage of players for years.</p>
<p>“This is great news for the consumer and for the regulated industry alike,” said John Pappas, executive director of the Poker Players Alliance. “Having another well-regulated state enter the market will mean more choices for consumers and better protections against scams and frauds perpetrated by unlicensed operators.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how big Colorado’s online poker market will be. But with other states seeing success with their own launches, there is plenty of reason for optimism.</p>
