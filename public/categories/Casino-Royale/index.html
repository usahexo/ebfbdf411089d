		<h1 id="Panathinaikos-Loser-Again-This-Time-at-Bettors-Hands"><a href="#Panathinaikos-Loser-Again-This-Time-at-Bettors-Hands" class="headerlink" title="Panathinaikos Loser Again, This Time at Bettors Hands"></a>Panathinaikos Loser Again, This Time at Bettors Hands</h1><p>Panathinaikos arguably had the best odds to win this year’s European Championship. But, just like in 2004 and 2012, they came up short yet again. This time, it was at the hands of a much smaller club, albeit one with some unexpectedly powerful backers.</p>
<p>Sparta Prague may have been the underdog in this matchup, but they were by no means unprepared. Czech billionaire and energy mogul Petr Kellner had funneled millions of dollars into the club in order to make them a top contender. And it paid off, as Sparta managed to pull off a stunning upset against Panathinaikos.</p>
<p>The loss is especially bitter for Panathinaikos given that they were massive favorites leading up to the match. The team is considered one of the most successful clubs in Europe, but they have now suffered three major championship defeats in just over a decade.</p>
<p>Kellner’s investment in Sparta is part of a larger trend of billionaires pumping money into sports teams around the world. In North America, there is Jerry Jones (Dallas Cowboys), Stan Kroenke (Los Angeles Rams), Stephen Ross (Miami Dolphins), and many others who have become major players in the sports world by investing vast sums of money into their favorite teams.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why billionaires are investing so heavily in sports teams. For one thing, it’s a way to create loyalty among fans and increase viewership numbers for their networks or channels. It’s also an effective way to promote their other businesses and brands. And finally, it’s a very tax-friendly way to invest money, since there are few restrictions on what teams can be bought and how profits can be distributed.</p>
<p>So far, the investments by billionaires have been paying off handsomely. Teams like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain have seen huge increases in revenue and popularity thanks to their new benefactors. And with more and more billionaires looking for ways to invest their money, it seems likely that sports teams will only become more expensive in the years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Panathinaikos-Couldn’t-Catch-a-Break-Againstbookmakers"><a href="#Panathinaikos-Couldn’t-Catch-a-Break-Againstbookmakers" class="headerlink" title="Panathinaikos Couldn’t Catch a Break Againstbookmakers"></a>Panathinaikos Couldn’t Catch a Break Againstbookmakers</h1><p>They say there’s no such thing as bad publicity, and Panathinaikos seems to be testing that adage this season. The club has had an unlucky year so far in the eyes of the bookmakers, with several high-profile defeats against top teams.</p>
<p>Most recently, they were beaten 2-1 by title contenders Olympiakos. The betting odds had Panathinaikos as clear underdogs for the match, and they duly lost though they put up a good fight. The results have been frustrating for the team and its fans, but may have also created some good opportunities for betting on Panathinaikos matches.</p>
<p>The next opportunity for Panathinaikos to get a win will be on December 2nd, when they take on AEK Athens. AEK is currently in last place in the league table, making them a tempting opponent for Panathinaikos to take on. The odds for this match have Panathinaikos as slight favourites, and so there may be some good value to be found in betting on them.</p>
<p>A victory against AEK would be a big boost to Panathinaikos’ confidence as they head into the second half of the season. They are currently in sixth place in the league table, which would put them in contention for a spot in European competition next year. However, they’ll need to start winning some of their tougher matches if they want to make it into the top four teams in Greece.</p>
<p>Panathinaikos has definitely demonstrated that it has the potential to compete with the best teams in Greece this season. With a bit of luck and some improved performances, they could soon be turning some of those losses into wins – and giving bookmakers something to think about.</p>
<h1 id="Amateurish-Panathinaikos-Easily-Picked-Apart-by-Betting-Community"><a href="#Amateurish-Panathinaikos-Easily-Picked-Apart-by-Betting-Community" class="headerlink" title="Amateurish Panathinaikos Easily Picked Apart by Betting Community"></a>Amateurish Panathinaikos Easily Picked Apart by Betting Community</h1><p>Coming into their Europa League match against Panathinaikos, Olympiakos were unsurprisingly favourites with the betting community. As expected, the home side put in a poor performance and were easily dispatched of, losing 5-0 on the night.</p>
<p>The first goal came after 14 minutes when centre back Jagos Vukovic headed in from a free-kick. The hosts continued to struggle and soon found themselves two down, as Kostas Fortounis converted from the penalty spot after Pape Abou Cisse had been brought down by Panathinaikos goalkeeper Odisseas Vlachodimos.</p>
<p>It was nearly three before the break, but Giannis Fetfatzidis’ header crashed off the crossbar. However, there was no stopping Olympiakos after the interval, as they added three more goals in quick succession.</p>
<p>First up was Brazilian midfielder Alan Kardec, who powerfully volleyed in from outside the area. Then it was substitutes El Arabi Haddadi and Stefan Mitrovic who got on the scoresheet, both finding the net with composed finishes.</p>
<p>It was an emphatic victory for Olympiakos and one that will have delighted manager Michel, who has been under pressure recently after some inconsistent results. Next up for them is a trip to fellow Greek side Atromitos in the league, before they return to Europa League action with a tie against German side Bayer Leverkusen.</p>
<h1 id="Panathinaikos-Falls-Short-Once-More-Leaving-Bettors-in-the-Dust"><a href="#Panathinaikos-Falls-Short-Once-More-Leaving-Bettors-in-the-Dust" class="headerlink" title="Panathinaikos Falls Short Once More, Leaving Bettors in the Dust"></a>Panathinaikos Falls Short Once More, Leaving Bettors in the Dust</h1><p>The Panathinaikos basketball team had another losing season, and this time, the team’s dismal performance cost bettors a lot of money.</p>
<p>Panathinaikos was one of the top teams in Europe a few years ago, but now the team seems to be on the decline. The fans have had to suffer through another disappointing season, and the bettors who placed their trust in Panathinaikos have lost out big time.</p>
<p>The team’s poor play has resulted in a number of high-profile players leaving the club. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Vujcic, and Stratos Perperoglou are just some of the players who have decided to move on.</p>
<p>This season was especially tough for Panathinaikos because they were battling relegation for most of the year. The team did manage to stay in the league, but that’s little consolation for fans and bettors alike.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how Panathinaikos bounces back next season. Hopefully, the team can get back on track and start winning again. In the meantime, bettors should avoid putting their money on Panathinaikos until there is more evidence that they are back on top of their game.</p>
<h1 id="Panathinaikos-Continues-to-Struggle-as-Bookmakers-Laugh-All-the-Way-to-the-Bank"><a href="#Panathinaikos-Continues-to-Struggle-as-Bookmakers-Laugh-All-the-Way-to-the-Bank" class="headerlink" title="Panathinaikos Continues to Struggle as Bookmakers Laugh All the Way to the Bank"></a>Panathinaikos Continues to Struggle as Bookmakers Laugh All the Way to the Bank</h1><p>The Panathinaikos football club has been one of the most successful teams in Europe over the past few years. However, this season they have been struggling, and their poor performance has angered many fans. Some people have even suggested that the club should be relegated to a lower division.</p>
<p>Bookmakers are taking advantage of Panathinaikos’s poor form by offering very high odds on them winning any given match. This is causing a lot of people to lose money, and it seems that the club’s management is doing nothing to address the problem.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for Panathinaikos’s poor form is their lack of firepower up front. The team’s top scorer this season is midfielder Tasos Donis, who has only scored 7 goals. This is a far cry from last season, when forwards Dušan Šakota and Facundo Pereyra were banging in goals for fun.</p>
<p>It is clear that Panathinaikos need to sign some new strikers in the January transfer window if they want to salvage their season. Unfortunately, their current financial situation may prevent them from doing so.</p>
<p>The fans are starting to lose patience with the club’s management, and there is a real danger that they could turn on them completely if things don’t improve soon.</p>
