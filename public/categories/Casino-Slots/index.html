The probe was launched after several reports surfaced that suggest the game is owned by Sheldon Adelson, a major Republican donor and casino magnate.</p>
<p>Adelson has been in the news recently for his support of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. His ties to Big Fish Casino Slots have led some to question whether the game is being used as a way to circumvent campaign finance laws.</p>
<p>The Nevada Gambling Commission has not made any official comments on the investigation, and it is still unclear what, if any, wrongdoing may have occurred. However, the probe is sure to generate a lot of interest in both the gaming community and political circles.</p>
<h1 id="Seattle-based-Big-Fish-Games-acquired-by-Macau-casino-operator"><a href="#Seattle-based-Big-Fish-Games-acquired-by-Macau-casino-operator" class="headerlink" title="Seattle-based Big Fish Games acquired by Macau casino operator"></a>Seattle-based Big Fish Games acquired by Macau casino operator</h1><p>On Tuesday, Seattle-based online game developer and distributor Big Fish Games announced that it has been acquired by the Macau casino operator SJM Holdings Ltd. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Big Fish Games, founded in 2002, is one of the largest casual games companies in the world. The company distributes more than 2,000 games to over 125 million players in 150 countries. It also has a portfolio of six owned studios. </p>
<p>“Joining forces with SJM will allow us to take our business to the next level and deliver even more amazing games and services to our players around the world,” said Big Fish Games CEO Paul Thelen in a statement.</p>
<p>SJM Holdings is a subsidiary of the billionaire Kwok family, which controls Macau’s biggest casino company, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau SA (SJM). </p>
<p>The acquisition comes as Macau’s casino industry is struggling due to a Chinese government crackdown on corruption. Revenues from gambling in Macau dropped 34 percent in 2017. </p>
<p>Casino operators are looking for new ways to diversify their businesses and Big Fish Games is seen as a strong fit due to its global reach and its experience in mobile gaming. </p>
<p>“Casual mobile games are growing rapidly all over the world and we see great potential in this market,” said SJM Holdings Deputy Chairman Ambrose So Shu Fai in a statement. “With Big Fish Games’ expertise in developing these types of games we can quickly adapt and bring our own new titles to this market.”</p>
<h1 id="Slot-machine-manufacturer-Bally-Technologies-acquires-Big-Fish-Games"><a href="#Slot-machine-manufacturer-Bally-Technologies-acquires-Big-Fish-Games" class="headerlink" title="Slot machine manufacturer Bally Technologies acquires Big Fish Games"></a>Slot machine manufacturer Bally Technologies acquires Big Fish Games</h1><p>On July 3, 2014, slot machine manufacturer Bally Technologies announced that it had acquired Bellevue, Washington-based Big Fish Games for $990 million in cash.</p>
<p>The acquisition is a strategic move by Bally to expand its offerings into the social casino market. Big Fish Games CEO Paul Thelen said in a statement that the two companies share “a common vision and commitment to provide our customers with industry-leading content and gaming experiences.”</p>
<p>Big Fish Games is a leading developer and publisher of casual games, with more than two dozen titles that have each been downloaded more than one million times. The company’s popular titles include “City of Secrets,” “Fairway Solitaire” and “Fishdom.”</p>
<p>Bally Technologies is best known for its slot machines and other casino games, but the company has been making a push into the social casino market in recent years. Its portfolio of social casino games includes “House of Fun,” “Bingo Blitz” and “Quick Hit Slots.”</p>
<p>With the acquisition of Big Fish Games, Bally now has access to more than 400 million registered users across desktop and mobile devices. Thelen said that the combined company will be able to offer “the richest, most engaging gaming experiences available today.”</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>
<h1 id="Zynga-buys-Big-Fish-Games-for-990-million"><a href="#Zynga-buys-Big-Fish-Games-for-990-million" class="headerlink" title="Zynga buys Big Fish Games for $990 million"></a>Zynga buys Big Fish Games for $990 million</h1><p>In a move that has surprised the gaming industry, Zynga has agreed to buy Big Fish Games for $990 million.</p>
<p>The move will give Zynga a foothold in the casual games market, which is currently worth an estimated $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting day for Zynga as we continue our strategy of building a leading social mobile gaming company,” said Mark Pincus, CEO of Zynga.</p>
<p>“With the acquisition of Big Fish Games, we are adding one of the best-known and most respected players in the casual game space to our team.”</p>
<p>Big Fish Games was founded in 2002 and has since become one of the world’s leading developers and publishers of casual games.</p>
<p>The company has developed a number of popular titles, including Mystery Case Files, Cooking Dash and Hidden Expeditions.</p>
<p>Commenting on the deal, Paul Thelen, CEO of Big Fish Games, said: “We are thrilled to join Zynga and bring our franchises and products to even more people around the world.</p>
<p>“Zynga has a tremendous track record in building successful social games, and their commitment to quality and engaging gameplay is unparalleled.”</p>
<p>Casual gaming is one of the most lucrative sectors in the video game industry, with estimated revenues of $2.5 billion this year. And now one of the world’s biggest casual game companies has been bought by one of the biggest social gaming companies. So what does this mean for the future of casual gaming?<br>Will Zynga try to kill off Big Fish’s competitors? Or will it merge them all into one big super-company? It’s hard to say at this point. But what is clear is that Zynga is serious about getting into the casual games market, and it’s going to be tough for any other company to compete with them now.</p>
<h1 id="Microsoft-acquires-Big-Fish-Games-for-2-5-billion"><a href="#Microsoft-acquires-Big-Fish-Games-for-2-5-billion" class="headerlink" title="Microsoft acquires Big Fish Games for $2.5 billion"></a>Microsoft acquires Big Fish Games for $2.5 billion</h1><p>On February 4, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Seattle-based Big Fish Games for $2.5 billion. The move gives the tech giant a foothold in the casual gaming market and positions it to compete with other major players such as Amazon and Apple.</p>
<p>For Big Fish Games, the acquisition is a chance to tap into Microsoft’s expansive resources and reach a larger audience. The company was founded in 2002 by Paul Thelen and has developed a portfolio of popular casual games such as “Bejeweled” and “Candy Crush Saga”.</p>
<p>Microsoft is betting that the trend towards casual gaming will continue, and that Big Fish Games will be able to provide it with an edge over its competitors. In a statement, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the acquisition would “accelerate our gaming ambitions.”</p>
<p>The deal is still subject to regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the end of the year.</p>
