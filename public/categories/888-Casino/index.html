This is seen as a way to bring in new revenue, as New Jersey has been struggling to make up for revenue lost when gambling was legalized in other states.</p>
<p>Sports betting has been illegal in New Jersey since 2006, when then-governor Jon Corzine signed a bill banning it. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down that federal law earlier this year, opening the door for states to legalize it if they choose.</p>
<p>Mayor Fulop believes that legalizing sports betting would be a major boon to the city’s economy. “This is about creating jobs and economic activity,” he said. “It will also bring new money into our city, and we need that.”</p>
<p>In order to pass such an ordinance, however, the mayor will need the support of the City Council. It’s not clear yet whether or not they will be on board with the proposal.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting could be a controversial move, as there are concerns that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling. But Mayor Fulop believes that those risks can be managed by implementing strong regulations. “We’re not just going to do this without any protections in place,” he said. “We’ll have all sorts of safeguards in place to make sure it’s done responsibly.”</p>
<h1 id="Inter-Milan-Looks-to-NJ-for-Expansion-Opportunities"><a href="#Inter-Milan-Looks-to-NJ-for-Expansion-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Inter Milan Looks to NJ for Expansion Opportunities"></a>Inter Milan Looks to NJ for Expansion Opportunities</h1><p>Italian soccer giant Inter Milan is looking to expand its operations in the United States, and New Jersey is one of their prime targets. The club has identified a number of potential sites for a new training ground and academy in the Garden State, as well as for a potential soccer-specific stadium.</p>
<p>Inter Milan has been interested in expanding into the U.S. market for some time now, and New Jersey is seen as an attractive location because of its proximity to New York City. The club’s management feels that there is significant potential for growth in the U.S., and they are planning to invest heavily in expanding their presence here.</p>
<p>One of the main priorities for Inter Milan is setting up a new training ground and academy in the U.S. They are currently looking at a few potential sites in New Jersey, and they are hoping to make a decision soon. The club also plans to build a soccer-specific stadium in the state, which would be used primarily for youth tournaments and other events.</p>
<p>Inter Milan’s plans for expansion are exciting news for soccer fans in New Jersey. The club has a rich history and a passionate fanbase, and it would be great to see them establish a strong presence in this state. There is no doubt that Inter Milan will be a welcome addition to the North American soccer landscape, and I can’t wait to see what they achieve here.</p>
<h1 id="Jersey-City-mayor-pushes-for-sports-betting-to-help-fund-schools"><a href="#Jersey-City-mayor-pushes-for-sports-betting-to-help-fund-schools" class="headerlink" title="Jersey City mayor pushes for sports betting to help fund schools"></a>Jersey City mayor pushes for sports betting to help fund schools</h1><p>Jersey City mayor Steven Fulop is proposing a new plan that would allow the city to offer sports betting in order to help fund its schools. The proposal would allow the city to collect a percentage of the betting action, which could amount to millions of dollars per year.</p>
<p>The proposal has gained traction in recent months, with a state senate committee voting in favor of it last week. The bill now heads to the full senate for a vote.</p>
<p>“This is an important issue,” said Fulop. “It’s something we’ve been working on for some time.”</p>
<p>Under the proposed plan, the city would partner with a casino operator who would run the sports betting operation. Jersey City would then be able to collect a percentage of the betting handle, which is expected to be in the range of 5-10 percent.</p>
<p>That could amount to millions of dollars per year for the cash-strapped school district. In fact, analysts estimate that New Jersey could generate as much as $100 million in annual revenue from legal sports betting.</p>
<p>Fulop believes that his proposed plan offers a win-win for both the city and its school district.</p>
<p>“This is something that can really benefit our schools,” he said. “It’s a no brainer.”</p>
<h1 id="Could-New-Jersey’s-Sports-Betting-Industry-Benefit-From-Inter-Milan"><a href="#Could-New-Jersey’s-Sports-Betting-Industry-Benefit-From-Inter-Milan" class="headerlink" title="Could New Jersey’s Sports Betting Industry Benefit From Inter Milan?"></a>Could New Jersey’s Sports Betting Industry Benefit From Inter Milan?</h1><p>The State of New Jersey, home to the NFL’s New York Giants and New York Jets, as well as MLB’s Philadelphia Phillies and NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers, wants a piece of the sports betting industry pie.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the US Supreme Court struck down a 25-year ban on state-sponsored sports betting, opening up the market to any state that wanted in.</p>
<p>New Jersey quickly moved to legalize the activity, but Chris Christie – the former Governor of the state – was unsuccessful in his efforts to bring a sports betting industry to Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Enter: INTER MILAN!</p>
<p>Inter Milan, one of Europe’s most iconic football clubs, is considering a move to New Jersey and establishing its own sports betting operation. The move could be an incredible boon for New Jersey’s nascent sports betting industry.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why this could be so. First and foremost, Inter Milan is one of the world’s most popular football clubs. With millions of fans around the globe, Inter Milan would instantly become one of the most recognized brands in New Jersey’s burgeoning sports betting market.</p>
<p>Second, Inter Milan is no stranger to gambling or casino operations. The club has long been associated with Italy’s renowned gaming industry and is even majority-owned by a casino company. This gives Inter Milan both the experience and expertise necessary to run a successful sports betting operation.</p>
<p>Lastly, Inter Milan already has a presence in the United States. The club has played numerous exhibition matches in major American cities over the years, and has a large fan base in the country. Establishing a physical presence in New Jersey would give Inter Milan direct access to its fans in the United States and further cement its popularity Stateside.</p>

<p>__</p>
<p>Jersey City, NJ – Jersey City mayor Steven Fulop has proposed a new plan to help fund the city’s schools. The proposal would legalize sports betting in the city, with the proceeds going directly to the school district.</p>
<p>“This is a common-sense solution to two pressing problems: funding our schools and keeping our residents safe,” said Fulop. “We have an opportunity to generate millions of dollars for our schools without raising taxes or asking residents to vote on a referendum. It’s a win-win for Jersey City.”</p>
<p>The proposal has already generated some controversy, with opponents arguing that it will increase gambling addiction and crime. But Fulop is standing firm, saying that the benefits of legalization outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>“These are legitimate concerns, but they can be addressed through responsible regulation,” he said. “And the potential benefits are too great to ignore. Our schools need this money, and our city needs this revenue.”</p>
