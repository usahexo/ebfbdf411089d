	  <h1 id="Dortmundaddons-three-goals-in-six-minutes-to-secure-victory-over-Augsburg"><a href="#Dortmundaddons-three-goals-in-six-minutes-to-secure-victory-over-Augsburg" class="headerlink" title="Dortmundaddons three goals in six minutes to secure victory over Augsburg!"></a>Dortmundaddons three goals in six minutes to secure victory over Augsburg!</h1><p>Dortmund came into the match knowing that they needed to win in order to keep up the pressure on Bayern Munich and stay in touch with the top of the Bundesliga. They started brightly and took the lead in the eighth minute when Christian Pulisic played a one-two with Shinji Kagawa before firing past Marwin Hitz.</p>
<p>The hosts doubled their lead just four minutes later when Marco Reus converted from the spot after Augsburg’s Dominik Kohr had been sent off for handball. The floodgates then opened as three goals in six minutes from André Schürrle, Mario Götze and Maximilian Philipp gave Dortmund an unassailable lead.</p>
<p>Augsburg did manage to pull one back through Kevin Danso late on, but it was nothing more than a consolation goal as Dortmund ran out comfortable winners.</p>
<h1 id="Late-drama-at-the-SIGNAL-IDUNA-PARK-as-Dortmund-come-from-behind-to-win"><a href="#Late-drama-at-the-SIGNAL-IDUNA-PARK-as-Dortmund-come-from-behind-to-win" class="headerlink" title="Late drama at the SIGNAL IDUNA PARK as Dortmund come from behind to win!"></a>Late drama at the SIGNAL IDUNA PARK as Dortmund come from behind to win!</h1><p>Dortmund came from behind to fire three goals past Augsburg in a dramatic victory at the SIGNAL IDUNA PARK.</p>
<p>The visitors were in control for much of the game, and took the lead midway through the first half when Caiuby’s effort was deflected home. Augsburg could have doubled their advantage before the break, but Ji Dong-won spurned two good chances.</p>
<p>BVB were a different proposition after the interval, and Christian Pulisic equalized with a fine finish shortly after the restart. Andriy Yarmolenko then put Dortmund ahead with an excellent volley, before Marco Reus made sure of the points late on.</p>
<h1 id="Dorndortmundschal-three-points-with-a-comeback-victory-against-Augsburg"><a href="#Dorndortmundschal-three-points-with-a-comeback-victory-against-Augsburg" class="headerlink" title="Dorndortmundschal three points with a comeback victory against Augsburg!"></a>Dorndortmundschal three points with a comeback victory against Augsburg!</h1><p>Dortmund started the game poorly and Augsburg took advantage of that. They scored in the first minute of the game, but that woke up Dortmund. The team played much better after that and they got the equalizer in the 25th minute through Pulisic. The comeback was completed in the second half with goals from Alcacer and Guerreiro. This is a big win for Dortmund and it keeps them in contention for a Champions League spot.</p>
<h1 id="BVB-come-back-from-two-goals-down-to-beat-FC-Augsburg"><a href="#BVB-come-back-from-two-goals-down-to-beat-FC-Augsburg" class="headerlink" title="BVB come back from two goals down to beat FC Augsburg!"></a>BVB come back from two goals down to beat FC Augsburg!</h1><p>This was a memorable game for Borussia Dortmund, who came back from two goals down to beat FC Augsburg 3-2.</p>
<p>The home side got off to the worst possible start, falling behind after just three minutes. Mario Gomez opened the scoring for Augsburg, and it was 2-0 to the visitors just before halftime, with Philipp Max getting on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>But Dortmund were not done yet. In the second half, they pulled one back through Marco Reus, and then equalised nine minutes from time through substitute Paco Alcacer. The winner came in injury time, as Alcacer grabbed his second of the game to seal an incredible victory for BVB.</p>
<p>This result means that Dortmund are now up to fourth in the Bundesliga table, just two points behind leaders Bayern Munich. With Champions League football on the horizon, they will be looking to build on this impressive comeback win in their next league game against VfL Wolfsburg.</p>
<h1 id="Borussia-Dortmund-score-three-late-goals-to-earn-a-comeback-win-against-FC-Augsburg"><a href="#Borussia-Dortmund-score-three-late-goals-to-earn-a-comeback-win-against-FC-Augsburg" class="headerlink" title="Borussia Dortmund score three late goals to earn a comeback win against FC Augsburg!"></a>Borussia Dortmund score three late goals to earn a comeback win against FC Augsburg!</h1><p>In a Bundesliga clash that ended 3-2 in favor of Borussia Dortmund, the home side showed great character to score three goals in the last fifteen minutes and earn all three points.</p>
<p>The visitors, FC Augsburg, had taken a 2-0 lead in the second half through strikes from Michael Gregoritsch and Caiuby, but Dortmund responded well and staged a comeback.</p>
<p>Marco Reus got them on the scoresheet with a well-taken goal in the 75th minute before Andre Schurrle and Maximilian Philipp sealed all three points for the hosts in injury time.</p>
<p>Dortmund are now third in the Bundesliga table, just four points behind leaders Bayern Munich, while FC Augsburg are 10th.</p>
