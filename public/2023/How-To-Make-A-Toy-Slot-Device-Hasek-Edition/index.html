<li>Materials</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to make your own toy slot device, you will need the following materials:<br>2. Glue Gun<br>3. Ruler<br>4. Toy Cars or Other Slot Toys<br>5. Pencil<br>6. scissors<br>7. paper clip (optional)<br>8 wire cutters (optional)<br>9. Hot Glue<br>10.Craft Knife<br>11 E6000 Glue<br>12 Metal coat hanger </p>
<p>  To make the body of the device, you will start by cutting a piece of metal coat hanger about 18 inches long. You will then cut it in half so that you have two pieces that are each 9 inches long .Using your wire cutters, you will then bend each piece at a 90 degree angle as pictured so that you have two “L” shapes . “&gt; Now take one of the “L” shapes and make a small loop at one end with your pliers as pictured- this will be our handle .Take the other “L” shape and cut off the top curve so that it is flat as pictured .Now we have to trim down our “L” shape so that it is the same size as the bottom of our handle . Do this by measuring 3 1&#x2F;2 inches from the loop on the top of the “L” shape and cutting it off with your scissors . Now take your hot glue gun and put a line of glue down the middle of your “L” shape as pictured . Place one half of your toy car or other slot toy on top of the glue and press down firmly . Make sure that both sides of your toy are glued down well .Now we need to make our stopper for the end of our device . Take your paper clip and fold it in half as pictured so that you have a small “U” shape . Then using your pliers, make a small loop on each end of the “U” shape as pictured . This is what we will use to keep our toy in place while it is in use . If you do not have a paper clip, you can use a small piece of wire cut off from your coat hanger instead<br>Now take your hot glue gun and put a line of glue down each side of your “U” shape as pictured .Press firmly onto either side of your toy car or other slot toy so that it stays in place<br>Now we can start assembling our device ! Take one piece of your metal coat hanger and put a line of hot glue down one end as pictured- this is where we will attach our handle  Take the other end of our metal coat hanger and twist it around until it forms a small circle like in the picture below  Make sure that it is tightly twisted together so that it does not come undone later on<br>  Now put a line of hot glue down the middle of your circle like in picture below<br>  Glue both ends of your circle together like in picture below<br>  Once dry, take another piece metal coat hanger and do exactly what you did with first piece- creating a small circle and twisting it together tightly making sure there are no gaps<br>  Now we will attach this second circle to first circle created earlier like in picture below<br>  Again, put a line of hot glue down the center and attach firmly to both circles</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-The-Easy-Way"><a href="#How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-The-Easy-Way" class="headerlink" title="How To Make A Toy Slot Device: The Easy Way"></a>How To Make A Toy Slot Device: The Easy Way</h1><p>Making a toy slot device is easier than you might think. In fact, it can be done with materials that are commonly found in your local hardware store.</p>
<p>The first step is to purchase a piece of PVC pipe. You will need to cut the pipe into two pieces: one that is 6 inches long and one that is 12 inches long.</p>
<p>Next, you will need to purchase a rubber stopper. This can be found at most hardware stores. The stopper should have a hole in the center that is big enough for the PVC pipe to fit through.</p>
<p>The final step is to drill a small hole in the top of the PVC pipe. This hole will be used to hold the rubber stopper in place.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to put it all together. Slide the PVC pipe into the rubber stopper, making sure that the hole in the pipe lines up with the hole in the stopper. Then, use a drill to make a small hole in the end of the PVC pipe. This will allow you to attach it to a dowel or other similar object.</p>
<p>There you have it! Your very own toy slot device made from easy-to-find materials.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-In-Less-Than-Five-Minutes"><a href="#How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-In-Less-Than-Five-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="How To Make A Toy Slot Device: In Less Than Five Minutes"></a>How To Make A Toy Slot Device: In Less Than Five Minutes</h1><p>Making your own toy slot device is a great way to spend an afternoon and it can be done in less than five minutes. All you need is some basic supplies and a little bit of creativity.</p>
<p>To get started, you will need a plastic bottle, a pair of scissors, some tape, and a pen or pencil. First, cut the bottom off of the plastic bottle. This will become the base of your toy slot machine. Next, cut two small slots into the side of the bottle. These will be the “spinners” for your machine. Finally, use tape to attach a paper clip to the top of the bottle. This will be your lever to spin the reels.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it! Now you can use your imagination to come up with games to play on your toy slot machine. You can even make up rules and betting systems to add an extra layer of excitement to the game. Have fun and enjoy!</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-Like-A-Pro"><a href="#How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-Like-A-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How To Make A Toy Slot Device: Like A Pro"></a>How To Make A Toy Slot Device: Like A Pro</h1><p>Making your own toy slot machine is a fun and easy project that you can do at home with some basic tools and supplies. In this article, we will show you how to make a toy slot device like a pro.</p>
<p>You will need the following supplies:</p>
<p>-Toy car or other small object that can fit into the slot<br>-Hot glue gun and glue sticks<br>-Popsicle sticks or other thin wooden sticks<br>-Ruler or measuring tape<br>-Scissors<br>-Paper clip<br>-Pencil<br>-Paint (optional)</p>
<p>First, measure and cut three popsicle sticks to the length of your toy car. Glue these popsicle sticks together in a triangle shape using the hot glue gun. The popsicle stick at the base of the triangle should be glued directly to the toy car. The other two ends of the popsicle sticks should be glued to each other, forming a triangular stand for your toy car. Let this dry completely.</p>
<p>Next, use the ruler or measuring tape to measure and mark two spots on one of the longer popsicle sticks that are half an inch apart. Then, use the scissors to cut a slit at each mark. This will create two slots that are just wide enough for your paper clip to fit through. Glue this popsicle stick to the top of your triangle stand, making sure that the slots are facing up. Let this dry completely.</p>
<p>Finally, use the hot glue gun to attach the paper clip to the top of your stand in between the two slots. Your toy slot machine is now ready to play!</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-With-Hasek"><a href="#How-To-Make-A-Toy-Slot-Device-With-Hasek" class="headerlink" title="How To Make A Toy Slot Device: With Hasek"></a>How To Make A Toy Slot Device: With Hasek</h1><p>I think it would be cool to make a toy slot device. And I think Tristan Hasek is the perfect guy to show us how. Let’s check it out!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get some wood and cut it into a rectangle that is about 11” by 7”.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cut two more pieces of wood, each about 5” by 1 1&#x2F;2”. These will be the sides of your slot machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Drill a hole in the middle of each 5” piece. The holes should be just big enough for a dowel or broomstick to fit through snugly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Glue or screw the three pieces of wood together so that you have a box that is 7” by 11”. Make sure the holes line up correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we can start making our toy slot machine look like a real one!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cut a thin piece of cardboard and glue it to the front of your machine, over the hole. This will be the payout window. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Paint or decorate your machine however you like! You can use stickers, decals, or even create your own designs. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Cut a small slit in the top of the cardboard payout window and insert a coin into it. Now your machine is ready to play!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To play, put a coin into the slot on top and pull back on the handle. The dowel will spin inside the holes on either side and cause the reels to spin as well. Depending on which holes the dowel ends up in, you could win big or lose everything!</p>
