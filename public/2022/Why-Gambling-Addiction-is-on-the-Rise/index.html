	  <h1 id="Why-Gambling-Addiction-is-on-the-Rise"><a href="#Why-Gambling-Addiction-is-on-the-Rise" class="headerlink" title="Why Gambling Addiction is on the Rise"></a>Why Gambling Addiction is on the Rise</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a pressing problem in many parts of the world. The advent of the Internet has made it easier than ever for people to gamble, and rising incomes have made gambling more accessible and attractive. Meanwhile, governments are struggling to keep up with the ever-changing landscape of online gambling, and they are often ill-equipped to deal with the social and financial implications of gambling addiction.</p>
<p>In developed countries such as the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, gambling addiction is a serious problem. In fact, according to The Guardian, “gambling addiction is now considered one of the most serious public health issues in the UK.” The number of people affected by gambling addiction is on the rise, and the negative consequences are becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a devastating impact on individuals and families. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, and even criminal behaviour. Gambling addicts often become isolated from friends and family members, and they can suffer from depression and other mental health problems. In extreme cases, gambling addiction can even lead to suicide.</p>
<p>Governments are beginning to realize just how serious a problem gambling addiction is. In response, they are taking steps to try to address the issue. For example, in 2017 the Canadian government launched a new national framework for addressing gambling problems. The framework is designed to help individuals and families affected by gambling addiction, as well as to support research into gambling-related problems.</p>
<p>Governments around the world are starting to recognize that gambling addiction is a serious problem that requires action. As awareness grows, it is hoped that more will be done to address this important issue.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Recognize-and-Treat-a-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#How-to-Recognize-and-Treat-a-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="How to Recognize and Treat a Gambling Addiction"></a>How to Recognize and Treat a Gambling Addiction</h1><p>Gambling addiction, also known as pathological gambling, is a serious mental disorder that can lead to financial and relationship ruin. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about 2 million Americans are addicted to gambling. While anyone can develop a gambling addiction, certain people are more at risk, including those who have a family history of addiction, suffer from bipolar disorder or depression, or struggle with impulsiveness.</p>
<p>If you think you may be addicted to gambling, there are certain signs you can look for. common symptoms of gambling addiction include chasing losses, lying about gambling, feeling guilty or shameful after gambling, hiding your gambling activity from loved ones, and experiencing financial problems as a result of gambling.</p>
<p>If you recognize any of these signs in yourself or a loved one, it is important to seek help immediately. Treatment for gambling addiction typically includes counseling and&#x2F;or medication therapy for any underlying mental health conditions. Behavioral therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be helpful in teaching addicts how to resist impulses and deal with cravings.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Gambling-Addiction-a-Mental-Disorder"><a href="#Is-Gambling-Addiction-a-Mental-Disorder" class="headerlink" title="Is Gambling Addiction a Mental Disorder?"></a>Is Gambling Addiction a Mental Disorder?</h1><p>Gambling addiction, also referred to as compulsive gambling, is a mental disorder that is characterised by an uncontrollable urge to gamble. Despite the negative consequences that may come as a result of gambling – such as financial problems, relationship issues and criminal activity – the addict is unable to resist the temptation to gamble.</p>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association and is used to diagnose mental disorders, does not currently include gambling addiction as a recognised mental disorder. However, some experts believe that gambling addiction should be classified as an addiction-related disorder due to its similarities with substance abuse disorders.</p>
<p>There are a number of signs and symptoms associated with gambling addiction, including:</p>
<p>• Persistent preoccupation with gambling thoughts<br>• Feeling the need to gamble more and more money in order to achieve the desired excitement<br>• Losing control over gambling behaviour, such as being unable to stop gambling even when faced with negative consequences<br>• Becoming agitated or irritable when trying to cut down on or stop gambling<br>• Hiding evidence of gambling from loved ones<br>• Neglecting important personal responsibilities (e.g. work, school, childcare) in order to gamble<br>• Continued gambling even after experiencing financial problems or other negative consequences as a result of gambling behaviour.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is displaying any of the signs and symptoms listed above, it is important to seek help from a healthcare professional. Treatment for gambling addiction typically includes counselling and&#x2F;or medication therapy.</p>
<h1 id="The-Dangers-of-Gambling-addiction"><a href="#The-Dangers-of-Gambling-addiction" class="headerlink" title="The Dangers of Gambling addiction"></a>The Dangers of Gambling addiction</h1><p>Gambling addiction, also known as compulsive gambling, is a type of impulse-control disorder. It is classified as an addictive behavior because it involves the person gambling despite negative consequences. Gambling addiction can have a serious impact on both the individual and their loved ones.</p>
<p>There are many dangers associated with gambling addiction. One of the most common dangers is financial instability. The individual may gamble away all of their money or damage their relationships with family and friends due to money they’ve borrowed to gamble. Other dangers include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Legal problems: The individual may get into legal trouble as a result of gambling, such as stealing money to gamble or becoming involved in illegal activities related to gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Health problems: Gambling can lead to health problems due to the amount of stress it causes. Some people may also develop a gambling addiction because they are trying to self-medicate for another mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety. This can exacerbate existing mental health conditions and lead to further health problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Relationship problems: Gambling addiction can cause significant relationship problems due to the amount of money and time that is invested in gambling. This can lead to arguments and fights between loved ones, and even divorce in extreme cases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. Treatment options include behavioral therapy, medication, and support groups. Seek help from a professional if you feel like you can’t control your gambling habits.</p>
