We’ve got all the tips and tricks you need to make some easy money.</p>
<p>First, always remember that the lower the number of icons on a machine, the higher the payout will be. So if you’re looking for a quick win, try to find a machine with only one or two icons.</p>
<p>Second, always bet on the element that corresponds to your character’s class. For example, if you’re playing as a Siren, bet on fire whenever possible. This will increase your chances of winning significantly.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that some symbols are more likely to appear than others. The three most common symbols are A, K and Q, so it’s best to bet on those whenever possible.</p>

However, for those who are struggling to win, there are a few ways you can cheat the slot machines and get the best rewards with little effort!</p>
<ol>
<li>Save your game before playing the slots</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step is to make sure you save your game before playing the slots. This is important as it will allow you to reload your game if you lose, without losing any of your progress.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use weapons with high elemental damage</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step is to use weapons that deal high amounts of elemental damage. The reason for this is that the Slot Machines have a weakness to certain elements, and by using weapons that deal elemental damage of that type, you can increase your chances of winning.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use class mods that boost your chances of winning</li>
</ol>
<p>Class mods can also give you a significant advantage when playing the slots. There are several class mods that boost your chances of winning, so be sure to equip one of these before playing!</p>
