	  <h1 id="Riverboat-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Online-Poker"><a href="#Riverboat-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Riverboat Gambling Now Legal in Online Poker"></a>Riverboat Gambling Now Legal in Online Poker</h1><p>The legal online poker scene in the United States has just gotten a lot more interesting with the recent addition of riverboat gambling to the list of permissible games. This change opens up a lot of new possibilities for US poker players, as the game variants available on major poker sites will now include popular games like Seven-Card Stud and Omaha Hi&#x2F;Lo.</p>
<p>Thanks to the loosening of restrictions on riverboat gambling, players will now be able to experience all the excitement and intensity of live casino poker without having to leave their homes. Furthermore, this development is likely to lead to more innovation in online poker, as site operators scramble to come up with new game variants that can take advantage of the new opportunity.</p>
<p>The news comes as a bit of a surprise, as many had predicted that online poker would grind to a halt after last year’s disastrous “Black Friday” crackdown by the Department of Justice. That event saw PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker, and Absolute Poker closed down by the DOJ, leaving players with few choices for playing real money poker online.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the US market is starting to thaw out a bit, as small operators slowly start reopening their doors and now major sites are expanding their game offerings. This bodes well for players looking for quality online poker options, and should help to ensure that the industry does not stagnate in light of last year’s tumult.</p>

<h1 id="Indiana-Authorizes-Gambling-on-Riverboats-–-Even-Online"><a href="#Indiana-Authorizes-Gambling-on-Riverboats-–-Even-Online" class="headerlink" title="Indiana Authorizes Gambling on Riverboats – Even Online"></a>Indiana Authorizes Gambling on Riverboats – Even Online</h1><p>The state of Indiana is one of the more recent states to legalize gambling on riverboats, and now lawmakers are authorizing gambling on those boats – even when the boats are located in other states’ waters.</p>
<p>Indiana first legalized gambling on riverboats in 1999 with the passage of House Bill 1345. At that time, land-based casinos were also legalized, but they were not allowed to operate within 10 miles of an existing casino. In 2007, lawmakers lifted that ban and allowed casinos to be built near one another.</p>
<p>With the legalization of online gambling in 2017, Indiana lawmakers decided that it was only fair to also allow gambling on riverboats – even if those boats were located in other states’ waters. This means that if you’re in Indiana and you want to gamble online, you can do so without having to leave the state.</p>
<p>Some people are opposed to this move, arguing that it will lead to an increase in problem gambling. But supporters say that it’s a way for the state to bring in more revenue, and that it will help create jobs.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much opposition to the move from other states. In fact, Ohio and Illinois both seem interested in working out a deal with Indiana that would allow their citizens to gamble on Indiana’s riverboats.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-Allows-Gambling-on-Riverboats-–-Including-Online"><a href="#Iowa-Allows-Gambling-on-Riverboats-–-Including-Online" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Allows Gambling on Riverboats – Including Online"></a>Iowa Allows Gambling on Riverboats – Including Online</h1><p>A recent bill that has passed in the state of Iowa will now allow gambling on riverboats, including online. This could be great news for the state’s economy, as it is expected to bring in more revenue from tourists.</p>
<p>This change in policy was actually proposed years ago, but it was shot down. However, with new leadership in place, things have changed and the bill has finally passed. It is now waiting for the signature of the governor, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p>The bill allows both land-based and online gambling on riverboats. There are a number of restrictions in place, such as a ban on table games and restrictions on the number of casinos that can operate. However, this is still a major change for the state and is expected to bring in a lot of money.</p>
<p>Gambling has been legal in Iowa for some time now, but this new bill will allow casinos to offer more games and will open up online gambling to residents of the state. This could be a major boon for the state’s economy, as it is expected to bring in millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>It is unclear exactly when the governor will sign the bill into law, but it is expected to happen soon. Once it does, Iowa will join a number of other states that offer legalized gambling online. This could be great news for players in Iowa, who will now have access to a wide range of gambling options.</p>
<h1 id="Missouri-Approves-Gambling-on-Riverboats-–-Including-Online"><a href="#Missouri-Approves-Gambling-on-Riverboats-–-Including-Online" class="headerlink" title="Missouri Approves Gambling on Riverboats – Including Online"></a>Missouri Approves Gambling on Riverboats – Including Online</h1><p>The Missouri state legislature has a new bill that will allow gambling on riverboats, including online. This new legislation was approved on Friday and now only requires the signature of Governor Jay Nixon to become a law.</p>
<p>The bill’s sponsor, state Representative Caleb Jones, believes that this will help create jobs in the state and bring in much-needed revenue. Gambling on riverboats has been illegal in Missouri since 1992, but this new bill would change all that.</p>
<p>Under the proposed bill, casino gambling would be allowed on any of Missouri’s six rivers. In addition, gamblers would be able to place bets online and over the phone. There would also be a new casino license created for up to four “land-based” casinos in the state.</p>
<p>Governor Nixon has not yet stated whether he plans to sign the bill into law but has praised it as a “jobs bill”. He is expected to make a decision in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill say that it will lead to more addiction and social problems. They also argue that it will cannibalize business from existing casinos in neighboring states.</p>
<p>If Governor Nixon does sign the bill into law, it will go into effect on August 28th.</p>
