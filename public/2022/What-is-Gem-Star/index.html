<p>There are a few strategies that you can use in Gem Star. One strategy is to try and connect as many gems as possible at once. This will cause a chain reaction and more gems will disappear. You can also try to clear out specific colors so that new ones don’t fill up the screen. If you’re having trouble making moves, try using power-ups. Power-ups can help clear out specific colors or chains of gems.</p>
