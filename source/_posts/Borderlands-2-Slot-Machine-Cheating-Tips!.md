#  Borderlands 2 Slot Machine Cheating Tips!

If you're looking to cheat at the Borderlands 2 slot machines, look no further! We've got all the tips and tricks you need to make some easy money.

First, always remember that the lower the number of icons on a machine, the higher the payout will be. So if you're looking for a quick win, try to find a machine with only one or two icons.

Second, always bet on the element that corresponds to your character's class. For example, if you're playing as a Siren, bet on fire whenever possible. This will increase your chances of winning significantly.

Finally, remember that some symbols are more likely to appear than others. The three most common symbols are A, K and Q, so it's best to bet on those whenever possible.
