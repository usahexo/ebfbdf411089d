#  Bible Endorses Gambling, So Play Poker!

Gambling is a popular pastime around the world, and many people enjoy playing poker for money. Some religious people may frown upon gambling, but does the Bible actually endorse gambling?

The answer is yes! The Bible actually has a lot to say about gambling, and most of it is positive. In fact, the Bible says that gambling is a “gift from God.”

1 Timothy 6:17 says, “Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.”

This verse shows that God approves of gambling, and even encourages us to enjoy it! Poker is just one way to gamble, and there are many other games out there that can be just as enjoyable.

Another verse that supports gambling is Ecclesiastes 9:11, which says, “Again I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happen to them all.”

This verse teaches us that luck plays a role in life and that we should not get too attached to earthly possessions. Gambling gives us a chance to win something valuable without relying on luck alone. It’s also a way to test our skills against others and see who is truly the best at a particular game.

The bottom line is that if you want to play poker or any other form of gambling for recreation and entertainment, then go ahead – the Bible approves! Just make sure that you don’t let gambling become an addiction or take over your life. Have fun while playing safely and responsibly!

#  Is Online Poker Biblical?

Is playing poker online biblical? The Bible doesn't specifically mention poker, so any answer to this question would be speculative.

There are a few reasons why some people might think that poker is not biblical. For one thing, poker is often seen as a game of chance, and the Bible seems to frown on games of chance (see, for example, Proverbs 13:11). Additionally, the Bible instructs us not to "lend Money at interest" (Deuteronomy 23:19-20), which some people see as an issue with poker, since the game involves taking financial risks.

On the other hand, there are also good reasons to think that poker can be a biblical activity. First of all, like any other form of gambling, poker can be addictive and potentially harmful. But if it's played in moderation and with proper caution, then there's nothing inherently wrong with it.

Second, while poker does involve some elements of chance, it's also a game that requires skill and strategy. Players who are skilled in the game can often make money off those who are not. So while chance may play a role in the outcome of any particular hand, success at poker ultimately depends on how well you play the game.

Finally, there's nothing inherently immoral about making money through gambling. Gambling can be viewed as a form of entertainment or recreation, and as long as the players involved are doing so responsibly and without damaging their own lives or the lives of others, then there's nothing wrong with it.

So is playing poker online biblical? Ultimately, that's something each person will have to decide for themselves based on their own understanding of scripture. But there are good arguments on both sides of this debate, so it's worth considering both sides before reaching a conclusion.

#  Playing Poker is a Sin According to the Bible

Playing poker is a sin, according to the Bible. Poker is a game that involves betting money on the outcome of a hand of cards. It is a popular game all over the world, and many people enjoy playing it, but the Bible says that gambling is sinful.

In Proverbs 28:8, the Bible says "He who increases his wealth by extortion and robbery Grows like a heath in the desert." This scripture is referring to people who make their money through gambling or other forms of cheating. The Bible also forbids gambling in Deuteronomy 23:17-18, which says "No one should curse their brother or sister or be angry with them in days of mourning. Do not lie in wait as a way to murder someone you hate; do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone. You must love your neighbor as yourself."

Gambling can lead to anger and hatred, and it can also ruin relationships. When people gamble, they often become addicted to it and lose all their money. This can lead to poverty and even homelessness. Gambling is therefore a sin, according to the Bible, and those who engage in it are breaking God's laws.

#  The Bible Does Not Ban Poker

The Bible does not ban poker. This is a false rumor that has been perpetuated for many years. In fact, there is no mention of poker in the Bible at all.

Some people might argue that the Bible mentions gambling, and since poker is a type of gambling, then it must be banned. However, this argument does not hold up under scrutiny. The Bible mentions gambling in several places, but it never actually bans it.

In fact, the Bible actually teaches that gambling can be a good thing. For example, in Proverbs 13:11, it says “Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow.” This verse teaches that gambling can be a way to make money slowly over time, which is a valuable lesson.

Another argument that some people might make is that playing poker can lead to addiction and ruin lives. While this may be true for some people, it is not true for all people. There are many people who play poker responsibly and do not let it ruin their lives.

In conclusion, the Bible does not ban poker. People who argue that it does are wrongheaded and mistaken. Poker can be a fun and enjoyable game when played responsibly
