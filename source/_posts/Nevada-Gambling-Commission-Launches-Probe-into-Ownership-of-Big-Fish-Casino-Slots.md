#  Nevada Gambling Commission Launches Probe into Ownership of Big Fish Casino Slots

The Nevada Gambling Commission has announced that it will be investigating the ownership of Big Fish Casino Slots, a popular online casino game. The probe was launched after several reports surfaced that suggest the game is owned by Sheldon Adelson, a major Republican donor and casino magnate.

Adelson has been in the news recently for his support of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. His ties to Big Fish Casino Slots have led some to question whether the game is being used as a way to circumvent campaign finance laws.

The Nevada Gambling Commission has not made any official comments on the investigation, and it is still unclear what, if any, wrongdoing may have occurred. However, the probe is sure to generate a lot of interest in both the gaming community and political circles.

#  Seattle-based Big Fish Games acquired by Macau casino operator

On Tuesday, Seattle-based online game developer and distributor Big Fish Games announced that it has been acquired by the Macau casino operator SJM Holdings Ltd. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Big Fish Games, founded in 2002, is one of the largest casual games companies in the world. The company distributes more than 2,000 games to over 125 million players in 150 countries. It also has a portfolio of six owned studios. 

"Joining forces with SJM will allow us to take our business to the next level and deliver even more amazing games and services to our players around the world," said Big Fish Games CEO Paul Thelen in a statement.

SJM Holdings is a subsidiary of the billionaire Kwok family, which controls Macau's biggest casino company, Sociedade de Jogos de Macau SA (SJM). 

The acquisition comes as Macau's casino industry is struggling due to a Chinese government crackdown on corruption. Revenues from gambling in Macau dropped 34 percent in 2017. 

Casino operators are looking for new ways to diversify their businesses and Big Fish Games is seen as a strong fit due to its global reach and its experience in mobile gaming. 

"Casual mobile games are growing rapidly all over the world and we see great potential in this market," said SJM Holdings Deputy Chairman Ambrose So Shu Fai in a statement. "With Big Fish Games' expertise in developing these types of games we can quickly adapt and bring our own new titles to this market."
