# Sheep Game Strategies Guaranteed To Help You Win

There are a few sheep game strategies that you can use to help guarantee your victory. In this article, we'll discuss each of them in detail and how you can utilize them for your next game.

#1: Spread Out The Herd

One of the most important sheep game strategies is to spread out the herd. If you keep them all bunched together, it will be easy for the shepherd to corral them into a tight area. By spacing them out, you make it harder for the shepherd to control them and gives each sheep a better chance of escape.

#2: Don't Frolic In The Open Field

When playing the sheep game, try not to frolic in the open field. This makes it easy for the shepherd to spot you and pick you off one by one. Instead, stay close to the trees and bushes where it's harder for the shepherd to see you. This will give you a better chance of making it to the end of the game.

#3: Avoid The Water

Another important sheep game strategy is to avoid the water. If you fall into the water, it will be difficult for you to escape and you'll likely wet yourself in the process. This will make it easier for the shepherd to catch you and could lead to your defeat.
